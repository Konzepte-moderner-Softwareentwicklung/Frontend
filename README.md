## Getting Started With The App

### Prerequisites

 - Node.js (version 18 or newer recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:Konzepte-moderner-Softwareentwicklung/Frontend.git
cd Frontend
cd frontendts

#Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Run the Application

If you want to run the backend and frontend locally start the backend first and then start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

this will start the frotend on port 5173, but locally use http://localhost only there the api endpoints will be available

# Internationalization

i18next is already configured for english and german. To add a language, add a new .json and add it to the config.tsx inside /src/i18next

# Notifications

You can trigger notifcations anywhere like this:
```js
import { toast } from "react-hot-toast";

toast.success('success text');
toast.error('error text');
```

# Styling via Tailwindcss and shadcn/ui

You can use Tailwind classes for layout and design
```bash
<div className="p-3 bg-amber-700 rounded-2xl"> Hello </div>
```

specific shadcn/ui components need to be installed first via npm
=>https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite under add components.  
They can then be added like this:

```js
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

<Button>Click here</Button>
```
